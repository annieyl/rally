The following summary outlines the development of a Personalized Career Navigation Platform, based on the conversation between the product manager and the client.

### High-level goals / business objectives
The primary objective is to centralize fragmented career resources into a single, accessible location to reduce the "information overload" currently experienced by college students. The project aims to bridge the gap between academic planning and professional goals by helping students understand how specific course selections impact their future careers. Additionally, the platform seeks to support overextended career advisors by providing an automated tool that offers personalized guidance, ensuring students receive tailored advice even when advisors are unavailable for one-on-one sessions.

### Requirements and constraints
The project is on a rapid development track, with a requirement to deliver a functional prototype by the end of the current semester (approximately an eight-week timeline). The initial pilot will support 500 users, with the long-term goal of scaling to the entire university. Development is being handled by a technical team of students, and the project must utilize an existing repository of career resources and the university course catalog. Regarding data privacy, the system will operate on an "opt-in" basis, allowing students to share their chatbot interactions with human advisors to ensure the accuracy and usefulness of the AI’s advice.

### Technical features
The core of the platform is an AI-driven chatbot that uses natural language processing to help students navigate career and academic data. Key features include a recommendation engine that suggests courses based on specific career paths (e.g., selecting electives for a career in FinTech) and step-by-step guides for technical interview preparation. The system will also include an advisor dashboard to allow staff to review student queries and provide feedback. While the bot provides personalized "pathing" and information discovery, it is explicitly out-of-scope for the bot to perform administrative tasks such as direct course registration or real-time appointment scheduling.

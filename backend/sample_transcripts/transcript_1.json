To help me transform this into a concrete project plan and define the scope, I need to dig a bit deeper into your vision.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down into a few key areas:\n\n### 1. Goals and Problem Statement\n*   **The \"Why\":** What is the specific problem you\u2019ve identified with how career information is currently accessed? (e.g., Is it too fragmented? Is it inaccurate? Is it gatekept behind expensive services?)\n*   **Examples:** Can you give me a few examples of when you or someone you know faced this problem? What specific situations do you anticipate users will be in when they turn to your solution?\n*   **Current Solutions:** What have you (or the target audience) already tried to do to solve this? Why didn't existing platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or O*NET work?\n\n### 2. Stakeholders\n*   **Target Audience:** Who are the primary users? (e.g., high school students, mid-career pivoters, refugees, or perhaps HR professionals?)\n*   **Other Stakeholders:** Who else is involved? Are there employers providing the data? Educational institutions? Mentors?\n\n### 3. Requirements and Constraints\n*   **Logistics:** Do you have a specific **budget** and **timeline** in mind for the first version?\n*   **Scale:** Are we looking at a local pilot program, or a global platform from day one?\n*   **Resources:** What do we have to work with right now? Do you already have access to a proprietary dataset, or are we building one from scratch?\n*   **Capabilities:** What is our team's current technical capability? Do we have developers, or are we looking for a low-code/no-code solution?\n*   **Technical Features:** What are the \"must-have\" features? (e.g., a searchable database, AI-driven recommendations, video interviews, or a community forum?)\n\n### 4. Assumptions and Risks\n*   **Assumptions:** What are we assuming to be true? (e.g., \"We assume people are willing to share their salary data\" or \"We assume users have reliable internet access.\")\n*   **Risks:** What are you most worried about? (e.g., data privacy, keeping information up-to-date, or competition from established players?)\n\n### 5. Deliverables and Scope\n*   **Phases:** What do you want to see at the end of Month 1? Month 3? (e.g., a prototype, a beta launch, or a full marketing site?)\n*   **In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope:** What is the one thing this project *must* do, and what are some things we should explicitly *avoid* doing for now to keep the project focused?\n\n**Is there anything else you want to add?**"

Project Goals & The Problem\n*   **The \"Why\":** What is the specific problem we are solving? Is it that students are overwhelmed by too many platforms, or that they aren't making the connection between their classes and their future careers?\n*   **Examples:** Can you give me an example of a situation where a student currently struggles because this tool doesn't exist? \n*   **Previous Attempts:** Has the university tried to solve this before (e.g., through a specific portal or manual advising sessions)? If so, what worked and what didn't?\n\n### 2. Stakeholders\n*   Aside from the **students** and the **career advisors**, who else needs to be involved? (e.g., The Registrar\u2019s office for course data, the IT department for integration, or perhaps potential employers?)\n\n### 3. Requirements & Constraints\n*   **Budget & Timeline:** Do we have a specific budget allocated? What is our target launch date (e.g., the start of the next academic year)?\n*   **Scale:** How many students are we supporting? Is this for one specific department or the entire university?\n*   **Resources & Capabilities:** \n    *   Do we have a technical team ready to build this, or are we looking for external vendors?\n    *   Is the course catalog data available via an API, or is it currently in a format that is hard to access (like a PDF)?\n*   **Technical Features & Maintenance:** \n    *   What does \"AI-driven\" mean to you in this context? (e.g., a chatbot, a recommendation engine for courses, or an automated resume builder?)\n    *   Who will be responsible for updating the career information once the platform is live?\n\n### 4. Assumptions & Risks\n*   **Assumptions:** Are we assuming students will proactively use this, or will it be integrated into a mandatory \"First Year Experience\" course?\n*   **Risks:** What are the risks regarding data privacy (FERPA compliance)? What happens if the AI gives a student bad advice regarding their graduation requirements?\n\n### 5. Scope & Deliverables\n*   **In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope:** \n    *   *In-scope:* Course recommendations, career paths, advisor-backed resources.\n    *   *Out-of-scope:* Are we including job postings/applications (like Handshake), or just the \"information and guidance\" layer? Are we including alumni networking?\n*   **Deliverables:** What do you want to see at each milestone?

Previous Attempts & Existing Data\n*   **What have you already tried?** Have you attempted to solve this with static resource lists, workshops, or existing software? What worked and what didn't?\n*   **What is our resource plan for data?** Do we already have a database of these \"too many resources,\" or do we need to build a system that scrapes/aggregates them? \n\n### 2. Constraints & Capabilities\n*   **What is our budget?** This will dictate whether we build a custom AI solution or use off-the-shelf tools.\n*   **What are our actual technical capabilities?** Do we have a development team ready to go? Who will be responsible for maintaining the platform once it\u2019s live?\n*   **Technical Features:** For that full-stack developer example, are you envisioning an interactive \"Roadmap Generator,\" a simple searchable directory, or an AI chatbot that \"interviews\" the student?\n\n### 3. Assumptions & Risk Factors\n*   **What are we assuming?** For example, are we assuming students will prefer a digital tool over waiting for an advisor? \n*   **What are the risks?** With a 2-month timeline for an entire university, what happens if the resource recommendations are inaccurate? Are there data privacy concerns regarding student records?\n\n### 4. Deliverables & Scope\n*   **What are the milestones?** Since we have 8 weeks, what do you want to see at the end of Week 2 (e.g., a prototype?), Week 4 (e.g., a beta with one department?), and Week 8 (Full Launch)?\n*   **In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope:** \n    *   *In-Scope:* (e.g., Resource curation, personalized pathing, advisor dashboard).\n    *   *Out-of-Scope:* Are we excluding things like direct job applications, resume reviews, or 1-on-1 video calling within the app?\n\n### 5.

We have information on resources in a repository already. Do not worry about budget for now. We have a tech team of students. This will be like an AI chatbot.

    "message": "This is a great foundation. It sounds like we are moving away from static documents toward a dynamic, personalized **AI Career & Academic Advisor Chatbot**. \n\nTo help me finalize the project roadmap and ensure the student tech team has a clear backlog, I need to drill down into a few more specifics. \n\n### 1. Examples & Use Cases\nYou mentioned personalized help with class selection and interview prep. To build the right prompts for the AI, I need to know:\n*   **Can you give me a specific scenario?** For example: \"A Junior Computer Science student wants to work in FinTech but doesn't know which electives will help them pass a technical interview at a big bank.\" \n*   **What have students done until now?** Have they been booking 1-on-1 appointments that are now overbooked, or are they just getting lost in the existing document repository?\n\n### 2. Stakeholders\nWe have the **Students** (users), the **Tech Team** (builders), and **Career Advisors** (reviewers). \n*   Are there other stakeholders? For example, does the **Registrar\u2019s office** need to be involved if the bot is giving advice on course requirements? \n\n### 3. Requirements & Constraints\n*   **Timeline:** Since we are using a student tech team, are we aiming for a prototype by the end of this semester, or a full launch for the next academic year?\n*   **Scale:** How many students are we expecting to use this simultaneously? (e.g., 500 students in one department, or 10,000 across the whole university?)\n*   **Technical Integration:** Does the chatbot need to \"talk\" to other systems (like the university course catalog or LinkedIn), or will it strictly use the information in your existing repository?\n*   **Maintenance:** Since student teams graduate/rotate, who will be responsible for updating the repository data so the AI doesn't give outdated advice?\n\n### 4. Assumptions & Risk Factors\n*   **Accuracy Risk:** What is the protocol if the AI suggests a course that doesn't actually fulfill a graduation requirement? \n*   **Data Freshness:** We are assuming the current repository is \"clean\" and up-to-date. Is there a process to verify this before we feed it to the AI?\n\n### 5. Defining Scope\nBased on our conversation, here is my initial draft of what is **In-Scope** and **Out-of-Scope**:\n\n*   **In-Scope (Included):**\n    *   Natural Language interface for searching the existing job/alumni repository.\n    *   Personalized course recommendations based on career goals.\n    *   Step-by-step guides for technical interview preparation.\n    *   An \"Opt-in\" dashboard for Career Advisors to see student queries and provide feedback.\n*   **Out-of-Scope (Excluded):**\n    *   Directly registering students for classes (the bot advises, but doesn't execute).\n    *   Real-time scheduling of appointments with human advisors.\n    *   Psychological or mental health counseling.\n\n---\n\n**Is there anything else you want to add?**"

    "message": "It sounds like we are starting to narrow down the scope. A prototype for 500 users by the end of the semester gives us a clear deadline and a manageable initial scale.\n\nTo help me transform this into a concrete project plan and define exactly what is in-scope and out-of-scope, I need to dig a bit deeper into the specifics. Could you help me with the following questions?\n\n### 1. The Problem & Examples\n*   **Specific Pain Points:** When you say students are \"getting lost,\" what does that look like in practice? Is the search functionality broken, is the folder hierarchy too deep, or is the naming convention confusing?\n*   **Real-world Example:** Can you describe a specific scenario where a student failed to find what they needed? For example: \"A student spent 20 minutes looking for the 'Final Project Rubric' but it was buried in a folder named 'Misc_Admin_2023'.\"\n*   **Past Efforts:** What have you already tried to do to solve this? (e.g., Have you tried reorganizing the folders or adding a search bar, and why didn't that work?)\n\n### 2. Stakeholders & Resources\n*   **Stakeholder Confirmation:** To make sure we're on the same page, I assume the stakeholders are the **Students** (end-users), **Faculty/Staff** (content uploaders), and **IT/Admin** (system maintainers). Is there anyone else, like department heads or external auditors?\n*   **The Team:** Who is actually building this? Do we have a team of student developers, or are we hiring external help? \n*   **Data Access:** Do we have access to the current repository's API or database, or will we be migrating files manually to a new system?\n\n### 3. Technical Requirements & Constraints\n*   **Budget:** Do we have a specific budget for hosting, software licenses, or development tools?\n*   **Core Features:** For the prototype, what is the \"must-have\" feature? (e.g., Is it an AI-powered search, a better UI/UX, or a tagging system?)\n*   **Maintenance:** Who will look after this system once the semester ends and the prototype is delivered?\n\n### 4. Assumptions & Risks\n*   **Content Quality:** Are we assuming the documents themselves are well-named and organized, or do we need to account for the fact that the source data might be a mess?\n*   **Technical Risks:** What is the biggest risk you see? (e.g., \"The current university server is too slow to support a new interface.\")\n\n### 5. Scope & Deliverables\n*   **In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope:** Are we just building a new *interface* to sit on top of the old repository, or are we building a brand-new *storage system*? \n*   **Milestones:** Beyond the final prototype, do you want a design wireframe by mid-semester or a user testing report?\n\n**Is there anything else you want to add?**"

When is the absolute latest this needs to be solved?\n*   **Data/Resources:** Do we have access to the backend of these pages (like a database or CMS), or are we just looking at them from the outside like a regular user?\n\n### 4. Assumptions and Risks\n*   **Assumptions:** Are we assuming that the content on these pages is actually valuable and just needs better organization? Or is it possible that a lot of the content is redundant and should be deleted?\n*   **Risks:** What happens if we build a solution and people still find it overwhelming? Are there security or privacy risks regarding who can see which pages?\n\n### 5. Deliverables and Scope\n*   **What do you want to see first?** Would you prefer a strategy document, a clickable prototype, or a list of recommended software tools?\n*   **In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope:** \n    *   *In-Scope:* (e.g., Organizing existing links, creating a search interface, tagging content).\n    *   *Out-of-Scope:* (e.g., Writing new content for the pages, fixing the actual design of the individual web pages themselves).
